The aim of this project is to build a wooden, bluetooth controllable toy train. The balancing and managing of four wheeled train engine is designed with the help of aurdino kit. 
This code will help to control forward, backward, left and right navigation of wheels. 

The input for the code is via a bluetooth controller signal and commands will be passed to function to rotate the wheels accordingly.
